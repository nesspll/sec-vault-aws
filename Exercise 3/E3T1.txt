Amazon GuardDuty is a continuous security monitoring service that analyzes and processes the following data sources: VPC Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail event logs, and DNS logs.
It uses threat intelligence feeds, such as lists of malicious IP addresses and domains, and machine learning to identify unexpected and potentially unauthorized and malicious activity within your AWS environment.





Findings from GuardDuty

UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce
i-06215d8691f47a6d7 is performing SSH brute force attacks against 10.192.10.94.
Brute force attacks are used to gain unauthorized access to your instance by guessing the SSH password.

10.192.11.115 is performing SSH brute force attacks against i-0d3d031614cca409a.
Brute force attacks are used to gain unauthorized access to your instance by guessing the SSH password.


So, GuardDuty uses CloudTrail logs, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS Logs

In this case it used VPC Flow Logs which were configured to send logs to an S3 bucket, VPC Flow Logs can be configured
to send logs to CloudTrail also. See the images for more details, where it is explaind the source of connection/attacks
