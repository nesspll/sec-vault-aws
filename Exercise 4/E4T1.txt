# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
1. Limit the SG of the instance to accept SSH connection only from the Bastion Host, or configure it with System Manager, and move it Private Subnet.
2. Prevent Root over SSH. Setup Instance USER with keys and disable password login.

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
1. Limit/modify the policy in the role we are using, to only have the permissions on the s3 free recipe bucket as a resource, permission we need, the role should not have access to everything.
2. Also enable encryption for the secret recipe bucket. Make it private, no need for public policy.
3. Also Access Points can be used to limit to a specific VPC access point.
