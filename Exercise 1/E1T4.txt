Poor Practices

1. S3 Poor Practice
- The IAM Role has full permissions on the S3 bucket. Here the Least Privilege Principle should be applied.
- Both of the S3 buckets have public access and encryption disabled. Here we need to remove public access and enable encryption.
- S3 should not be accessed publicly, but privately.

2. Security Groups Poor Practice
- WebAppSG is wide to open, everything is open, all traffic. The Instance should be moved to a Private Subnet, and only recieve connections on 443(an SSL connection
between ELB and Instance.) The Instance should if needed only recieve access from the Bastion Host, through its SG.


3. Network Poor Practices
- Private Subnets are connected to the internet via Internet Gateway. This should be fixed by implementing the NAT Gateway instead, and control egrees rules.
- Also, Network ACL are wide to open. Here restriction is needed, and Bastion Host solution should be implemented if needed.
