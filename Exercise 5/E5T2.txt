# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates

I choosed CFripper which is a Library and CLI tool for analysing CloudFormation templates and check them for security compliance.

### Example vulnerability
EC2SecurityGroupMissingEgressRule: Missing egress rule in NoIngressSecurityGroup means all traffic is allowed outbound. Make this explicit if it is desired configuration




##Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
Anchore Engine - A service that analyzes docker images and applies user-defined acceptance policies to allow automated container image validation and certification
